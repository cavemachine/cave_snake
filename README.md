# cave_snake
A scratch of a snake like game for linux terminal made in C and ncurses.
Use xterm to run, others VTE based terminals seems to do not draw the screen correctly, i'm not sure why.

Download, compile and run:
  $ git clone http://github.com/cavemachine/cave_snake.git
  $ gcc -o cave_snake cave_snake -lncurses
  $ ./cave_snake
